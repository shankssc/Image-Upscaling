# Image Upscaling using Deep learning

This project is part of the curriculum in ENGR-E533 (Deep learning Systems) course at IU. The goal of this project was to enhance the resolution of a set of images and
return high quality images as output. The visual presentation for this project can be found on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/cyD4tQKoBOg).

The slides of this projct are included in the repository itself as [`Presentation.pptx`](./Presentation.pptx) as well the report that outlines the work done for this
project, [`Image_Upscaling.pdf`](./Image_upscaling.pdf).
